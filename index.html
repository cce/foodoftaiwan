              <p>For all that’s been said and done about the food of China, relatively little has been recorded, elucidated, praised, defended, or savored in the Western world with regards to the food of Taiwan—then and now. This book takes a long look at the history of Taiwan and its cuisine and how it’s manifested today through easy-to-follow recipes. Through the lens of its half-Taiwanese American food writer author, Cathy Erway, Taiwanese food comes into focus. We explore the social and environmental factors that led to its being, and celebrate the proud cultures that have mingled within it.</p>
              <p>Many today recognize Taiwan as a stronghold of traditional arts and culture from China, which it deserves the prestige for preserving. But there is another side to Taiwanese cuisine, one based on humble, practical peasant foods that have sustained its populations for the many torn centuries to today. This cuisine transcends political or ethnic boundaries, and it continues to grow in myriad ways. It also exemplifies the simple comfort foods of my youth. This is the cuisine that The Food of Taiwan spotlights.</p>
              <p>Understanding that there is no real “one way” to make a certain dish, no matter how famous or fabled it is, we warmly invite the opinions of many in Taiwanese cookery. If you have suggestions about dishes that are or aren’t included in The Food of Taiwan, I look forward to sharing them on this website or this book’s Facebook page, or cooking with you sometime.</p>

              <p>is the author of <a href="http://theartofeatingin.com/" target="_blank">The Art of Eating In: How I Learned to Stop Spending and Love the Stove</a>, which USA Today hailed, “deserves a toast” and was named one of the “Top Favorite Cookbooks” of 2010 by Serious Eats. It was based on her two years of going without restaurant food and her popular blog on that topic, <a href="http://noteatingoutinny.com/" target="_blank">Not Eating Out In New York</a>. In the process of rediscovering the merits of the home-cooked meal, she explored the underbelly of New York City’s food culture, cooking for supper clubs, organizing amateur cook-offs, trash diving with the “freegan” community and foraging for wild edibles in the park.</p>
              <p>Cathy has written about food at The Huffington Post, Saveur, PAPER Magazine, Serious Eats, Civil Eats, The L Magazine, Edible Manhattan and Edible Brooklyn. Cathy hosts the weekly talk radio podcast, <a href="http://www.heritageradionetwork.com/programs/24-Eat-Your-Words" target="_blank">Eat Your Words</a>, on Heritage Radio Network. Cathy co-founded the half-Asian social group and supper club, The Hapa Kitchen. She has hosted numerous fundraiser events for local food causes. She lives, writes, cooks and grows in Brooklyn.</p>
