            <p>
              <h3>Pete Lee</h3> is a San Francisco-based filmmaker and photographer. He was raised in Taiwan, and has made it his life’s mission to incorporate the colors, textures, sight, and sound of his experience growing up in all of his work. Many of his projects involve food, musicians, and stunt men. His work has been featured on Vice, The Rolling Stone, MTV, and NPR.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pete and Cathy met at Emerson College in 2005 and have been friends and food and film nerds ever since.

            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <p>
              <h3>Cathy Erway</h3> is the author of The Art of Eating In: How I Learned to Stop Spending and Love the Stove, which USA Today hailed, “deserves a toast” and was named one of the “Top Favorite Cookbooks” of 2010 by Serious Eats. It was based on her two years of going without restaurant food and her popular blog on that topic, Not Eating Out In New York. In the process of rediscovering the merits of the home-cooked meal, she explored the underbelly of New York City’s food culture, cooking for supper clubs, organizing amateur cook-offs, trash diving with the “freegan” community and foraging for wild edibles in the park.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cathy has written about food at The Huffington Post, Saveur, PAPER Magazine, Serious Eats, Civil Eats, The L Magazine, Edible Manhattan and Edible Brooklyn. Cathy hosts the weekly talk radio podcast, Eat Your Words, on Heritage Radio Network. Cathy co-founded the half-Asian social group and supper club, The Hapa Kitchen. She has hosted numerous cooking classes and fundraiser events for local food causes, and has spoken on panels about food trends and blogging. She lives, writes, cooks and grows in Brooklyn.
